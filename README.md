https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-covid-19-vaccinations/resource/61ab4ad4-fb84-4789-95c9-cbe116414287 - this data set includes data on vaccinations in Allegheny county, including all the neighborhoods of the city of Pittsburgh and many other cities in the county.

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data/resource/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f - this data set includes data on police arrests and the reasons for the arrests in Allegheny County, including data outside of Pittsburgh.

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-property-tax-delinquency/resource/ed0d1550-c300-4114-865c-82dc7c23235b - this data set includes data on tax delinquency in Allegheny County including most of Pittsburgh's neighborhoods, although some did not have any instances of tax delinquency according to the data.

This is our final project for Big Ideas in Computing and Information, where we use Python to determine what the best neighborhood of Pittsburgh is based on whatever metrics we can find data to support.
